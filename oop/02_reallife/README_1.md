The program below illustrates how to create an object of a class.
Each class must be saved in the appropriate separate file.
NamesMain creates an object of NamePrinter and SurnamePrinter using the new keyword.
Variables namePrinter and  surnamePrinter refer to the respective objects.
Note that the first character of the class names are upper case and the variable names start with a lower case letter. This is a java standard and must always be obeyed.
