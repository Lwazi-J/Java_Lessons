Up version the classes from the above challenge by adding the number 4 to NameMain4 only.
Rename the other three classes to a name of your choosing to make sure the names make sense e.g. If the class prompts for a colour call it ColourGetter and it should have a method name getColour() which returns a string which will be a colour.
Instantiate each class and call the respective methods and ensure the code works as above 
Note: This is a creative coding challenge. You should come up with your own class names and methods and prompting strings.
