The difference between overriding and overloading can be summarized as follows:

Overriding:

Overriding is related to inheritance and occurs between a superclass and its subclass.
It involves providing a different implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.
The method signature (name, parameters, and return type) must be the same in both the superclass and subclass.
The purpose is to redefine the behavior of an inherited method in the subclass to suit its specific needs.
Overriding is determined at runtime based on the actual object type (dynamic polymorphism).
Annotated with @Override (optional but recommended) to enhance clarity and catch potential mistakes.




Overloading:

Overloading occurs within the same class or between different classes, regardless of inheritance.
It involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
The overloaded methods must have different parameter lists (number, types, or order of parameters).
The purpose is to provide multiple methods with similar functionality but different input options.
Overloading is determined at compile-time based on the method arguments.
No annotation is used for overloading.
In summary, overriding is about providing a different implementation of an inherited method in the subclass, while overloading is about defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class or between different classes. Overriding is based on inheritance and dynamic polymorphism, while overloading is based on providing different options for method invocation based on the arguments passed.
