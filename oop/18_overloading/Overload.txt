The following program has a compilation error.

Example
JohnOver.java
public Class JohnOver{
    public Stirng getName(){
        return "John";
    }
    public Stirng getName(){
        return "Peter";
    }
}


What is wrong with the above program?

Answer:
The JohnOver class has two methods with the same signature, getName(). 
It seems to be an error in the program where the method is defined twice with the same name. 
This results in a compilation error as Java does not allow multiple methods with the same name and parameters in a class.
To fix this issue, you need to provide different names for the methods or adjust their signatures (e.g., by using different parameters or return types) to make them distinct.


Fix the above program so that it can compile.

Paste your new program below
public class JohnOver {
    public String getName() {
        return "John";
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return "Peter";
    }
}
