Local classes have the following characteristics:

Scope: 
Local classes are only visible within the block of code where they are defined. 
They cannot be accessed outside of that block, including in other methods or classes.

Accessibility: 
Local classes can access all the members (fields, methods, etc.) of the enclosing class, as well as local variables and parameters of the enclosing block. 
However, they can only access final or effectively final local variables and parameters. 
An effectively final variable is one that is not explicitly declared as final but is never modified after its initialization.

Declaration: 
Local classes are declared within a block using the syntax class ClassName { ... }. 
They can have their own fields, methods, and constructors just like regular classes.

Object Creation: 
Objects of local classes can only be created within the block where they are defined. 
Once the block is exited, the objects become unreachable, and their memory is eligible for garbage collection.

Are local class is re-usable

No, a local class is not inherently reusable outside of the block where it is defined. 
Local classes are designed to be used within a specific context or scope and are not intended for widespread reuse in different parts of the codebase.

The visibility of a local class is limited to the block in which it is defined, such as a method or a constructor. 
Once the block is exited, the local class becomes inaccessible, and its objects cannot be created or used anymore.

If you need a class that can be reused in multiple contexts or accessed from different parts of your codebase, it's more appropriate to define a top-level class or a nested class (static inner class or non-static inner class) with broader visibility and scope. 
These types of classes can be instantiated and used in various parts of your program.
