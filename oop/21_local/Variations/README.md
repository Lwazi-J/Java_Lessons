Here are a few Java code examples that demonstrate the usage and my understanding of local classes

Example 1: Local Class Implementing an Interface

Example 2: Local Class Accessing Local Variables

Example 3: Local Class with Constructor


These examples demonstrate different aspects of local classes, such as implementing interfaces, accessing local variables, and defining constructors.
