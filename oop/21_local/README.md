OOP 16.2 Local Classes

Java local classes, also known as local inner classes, are classes that are defined within a block of code, such as within a method, constructor, or even another class. 
These classes are limited in scope and can only be accessed within the block in which they are defined.

Local classes are often used when you need to define a class that is closely related to a specific method or block and is not needed outside of that context. 
They can be useful for implementing event handlers, callbacks, or small utility classes.
