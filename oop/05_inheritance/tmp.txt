In real life it is said that when you have children they extend your family.
Therefore you extend your parents and your parents extend your grand parents etc

In Java, classes can have the same relationship as people. A class can be a child to another and inherit some of its methods or variable.

The parent is called the super-class.
The child is called the sub-class.
The Grand-parent class called the base class. Because it is the root/base of the inheritance tree.
