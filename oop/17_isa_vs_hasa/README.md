In Java, "is-a" and "has-a" relationships are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming:

"is-a" Relationship (Inheritance):
The "is-a" relationship, also known as inheritance or specialization, is a relationship between classes where one class is a specialized version or subtype of another class. 
It signifies an inheritance hierarchy where a subclass inherits properties, methods, and behaviors from a superclass.

For example:

class Animal { ... }

class Dog extends Animal { ... }

In this case, Dog is a subclass of Animal, indicating that a Dog "is-a" type of Animal. 
The Dog class inherits the characteristics of the Animal class and can add its own specific behaviors.



"has-a" Relationship (Composition):
The "has-a" relationship, also known as composition or aggregation, is a relationship between classes where one class has a reference to another class as a member variable. 
It signifies that one class contains or uses an object of another class as part of its implementation.

For example:

class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    ...
}

class Engine { ... }

In this case, the Car class has a "has-a" relationship with the Engine class, as it contains an Engine object as a member variable. 
The Car class can utilize the functionalities of the Engine class and delegate tasks to it.

The "is-a" relationship focuses on inheritance and hierarchy, while the "has-a" relationship focuses on composition and containing/referencing objects. 
Both relationships are important in designing object-oriented systems, allowing for code reuse, abstraction, and modeling real-world relationships effectively.
