What is a Java Object Constructor?
It is a special type of method found inside a class, that is run only once when an object is created.
It is special because it does not have a return type.
It also has the same name as the class. If your class is called Account the constructor would be called Account as well.
If you write a class and you do not write a constructor the compiler writes a blank "default constructor" for you.
If you want your object to do something special before it is created the constructor is the best place to place such code.
