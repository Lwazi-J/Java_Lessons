Pass-by-reference.
Is when you have a value and you create a handle to in and you pass that handle to the next class or object as a parameter.
This means if the receiving object (which we will refer to as object B) want to changes this parameter it will use the handle to manipulate the original object in the caller (Which we will refer to as Object A).

All objects are pass-by-reference
