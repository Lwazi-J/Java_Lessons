Pass-by-value. 
I when you have a value and you make a copy of it and you pass that copy to the next class or object as a parameter. 
This means that even if the receiving object (which we will refer to as object B) changes the parameter then it only changes the copy but the original remains the same.

All primitive data types are pass-by-value
