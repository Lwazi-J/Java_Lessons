Superstructure

Definition:
an object, idea, or complex that is derived from something more basic
Example 1:
There are going to be new provisions for superstructures
Example 2:
There is a risk that the bureaux will become top-heavy superstructures.

Substructure

Definition:
an underlying or supporting part of a structure
Example 1:
A pit sunk into the structure revealed the presence of two earlier substructures.
Example 2:
The bridge's substructure was damaged.


Super class

Definition:
In object-oriented programming, a class from which other classes inherit code is called a superclass.
Example 1:
This makes sure the allocation is valid before calling the superclass.
Example 2:
This technique is referred to as enveloping the superclass 's operation.



Super class constructor

Definition:
As is common knowledge, the default constructor of a class is invoked whenever an object of that class is created. We utilize super() to specifically invoke the superclass constructor from the subclass constructor.
Example 1:
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
Example 2:
We use super keyword to call the members of the Superclass



Sub-Class

Definition:
A subclass is a class that is descended from another class (also a derived class, extended class, or child class).
Example 1:
By default, methods cannot be overridden by a subclass.
Example 2:
The first class is a subclass of the second class.



Sub-Class constructor

Definition:
A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass.
Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
Example 1:
A subclass needs a constructor if the superclass does not have a default constructor
Example 2:
Fields, methods, and nested classes are all members that a subclass inherits from its superclass.
Subclasses cannot inherit constructors since they are not members; nonetheless, they may call the constructor of the superclass.
