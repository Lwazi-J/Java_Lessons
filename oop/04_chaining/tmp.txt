Constructor Chain

Definition:
Calling one constructor from another with respect to the current object is known as constructor chaining.
Example 1:
Constructor chaining occurs through inheritance.
Example 2:
Constructor chaining can be achieved in any order.

What is a Java Object Constructor Chain?
It is simply when a constructor calls another constructor.

Why do we need constructor chaining?
In cases where we do not want to duplicate construction logic in all the constructors.
e.g. If an object has 3 member variables a, b and c and the rule is c = a + b.
Then regardless of which constructor is called the c = a+b logic must be called.
We can put this logic in a single constructor which all other constructors call.
