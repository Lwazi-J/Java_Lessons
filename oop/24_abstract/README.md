In the context of programming, concrete and abstract are often used as antonyms, representing opposite concepts. 
The term "antonym" refers to words or concepts that have opposite meanings or characteristics.

In the context of classes and objects:

Concrete Class vs. Abstract Class:
A concrete class is a class that provides a complete implementation and can be directly instantiated to create objects. 
It represents a specific, tangible concept with all its methods and attributes defined. 
On the other hand, an abstract class is a class that is intended to be inherited by other classes. 
It contains one or more abstract methods that do not have an implementation and need to be overridden by the concrete subclasses. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.



In the context of methods:

Concrete Method vs. Abstract Method:
A concrete method is a method that has a complete implementation within a class. 
It provides the actual code that defines the behavior and functionality of the method. 
On the contrary, an abstract method is a method declared without an implementation in an abstract class or interface. 
It defines a contract or requirement for the classes that implement or extend the abstract entity, specifying the method's signature without providing the implementation details.


These examples illustrate how concrete and abstract concepts are used in the context of classes and methods. 
Concrete entities are complete, tangible, and directly usable, while abstract entities provide blueprints, contracts, or requirements that need to be implemented or extended by concrete subclasses or classes.
