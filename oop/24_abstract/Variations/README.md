Here are a few Java code examples that demonstrate my understanding of abstract classes and their usage


Example 1: Abstract Class with Concrete and Abstract Methods

Example 2: Abstract Class with Abstract Methods Only

Abstract classes provide a way to define common behavior and characteristics that can be shared by multiple subclasses. 
They can have both concrete and abstract methods. 
Concrete methods provide default behavior, while abstract methods define contracts that must be implemented by subclasses.

Note that abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, but they can be used as reference types. 
They are typically extended by concrete subclasses that provide implementations for the abstract methods. 
Abstract classes enable code reusability and help define common behavior and structure in object-oriented programming.
