Example 2: Abstract Class with Abstract Methods Only


In this example, the Shape class is an abstract class that declares two abstract methods, 
draw() and getArea(). 
The Circle class extends Shape and provides the implementations for both abstract methods. 
An object of the Circle class is created, and its methods are invoked.
