Example 1: Abstract Class with Concrete and Abstract Methods

In this example, the Animal class is an abstract class that defines a concrete method
eat() and an abstract method makeSound(). 
The Dog class extends Animal and provides an implementation for the makeSound() method. 
An object of the Dog class is created, and its methods are invoked.
