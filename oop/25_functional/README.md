Java has forever remained an Object-Oriented Programming language. 
By object-oriented programming language, we can declare that everything present in the Java programming language rotates throughout the Objects, except for some of the primitive data types and primitive methods for integrity and simplicity. 
There are no solely functions present in a programming language called Java. 
Functions in the Java programming language are part of a class, and if someone wants to use them, they have to use the class or object of the class to call any function.

Java Functional Interfaces
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. 
They can have only one functionality to exhibit. 
From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. 
A functional interface can have any number of default methods. 
Runnable, ActionListener, and Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces.

Functional Interface is additionally recognized as Single Abstract Method Interfaces. 
In short, they are also known as SAM interfaces. 
Functional interfaces in Java are the new feature that provides users with the approach of fundamental programming.

Functional interfaces are included in Java SE 8 with Lambda expressions and Method references in order to make code more readable, clean, and straightforward. 
Functional interfaces are interfaces that ensure that they include precisely only one abstract method. 
Functional interfaces are used and executed by representing the interface with an annotation called @FunctionalInterface. 
As described earlier, functional interfaces can contain only one abstract method. 
However, they can include any quantity of default and static methods.

In Functional interfaces, there is no need to use the abstract keyword as it is optional to use the abstract keyword because, by default, the method defined inside the interface is abstract only. 
We can also call Lambda expressions as the instance of functional interface.
