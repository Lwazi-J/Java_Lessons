Here are some Java code examples that demonstrate my understanding on polymorphism

Example 1: Polymorphism with Inheritance

Example 2: Polymorphism with Interfaces

These examples showcase how polymorphism allows different objects to be treated uniformly based on their common superclass or interface, enabling flexibility, code reusability, and dynamic behavior based on the actual type of the object at runtime.
