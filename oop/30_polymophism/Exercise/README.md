This is an exercise on objects and casting

Perform the following tasks:
Write a Class named Morph1 the class must be empty.


Write a main class named MorphMain. In the main method:
create an instance of Morph1 named morph1.
Create a vairiable called target of type Object initialize it to null.
Assign the instance of Morph1 to variable target.


Change the above program such that you re-assign the instance of target back to inst1.
Hint you need to cast in order to achieve this.
