Packages serve several purposes

Organization: 
Packages provide a way to logically organize and group related classes and resources. 
It helps in maintaining a structured and manageable codebase, especially in large projects.

Encapsulation: 
Packages allow for encapsulation and access control. 
By using access modifiers like public, private, protected, and default access, classes within a package can control the visibility of their members to other classes within the same package.

Name-spacing: 
Packages provide a unique namespace for classes. 
They help avoid naming conflicts by ensuring that classes with the same name can coexist within different packages.

Modularity and Reusability: 
Packages enable modularity by grouping classes based on their functionality or purpose. 
It promotes code reuse as packages can be imported and used in other parts of the project or even in different projects.

Access Control: 
Packages allow you to control access to classes and members at the package level. 
You can specify which classes and members are accessible to other packages by using the public, protected, and default access modifiers.
