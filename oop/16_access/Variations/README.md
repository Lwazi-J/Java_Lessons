In this example:

The AccessSpecifierDemo class contains the main() method, where an instance of the MyClass class is created.
Inside the main() method, we demonstrate accessing different members of the MyClass class using different access specifiers.
The publicVar and publicMethod() are accessible because they have the public access specifier.
The privateVar and privateMethod() are commented out because they have the private access specifier, making them inaccessible from outside the MyClass class.
Similarly, the protectedVar, protectedMethod(), defaultVar, and defaultMethod() are commented out because they have protected and default (package-private) access respectively, and can only be accessed within the same class or in subclasses within the same package.
By running this program and observing the compilation errors, it helps demonstrate the behavior and restrictions imposed by different access specifiers in Java.
