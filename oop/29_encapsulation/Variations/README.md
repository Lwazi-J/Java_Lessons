Here are some Java code examples that demonstrate my understanding on encapsulation

Example 1: Simple Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

Example 2: Encapsulation with Validation

Encapsulation, as demonstrated in these examples, allows for better control over the accessibility and manipulation of data within a class. 
It provides a way to protect the internal state of an object, enforce validation or constraints, and maintain code organization and modularity.
