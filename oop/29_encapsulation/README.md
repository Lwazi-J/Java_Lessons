OOP 20 Encapsulation

In computer programming and software engineering, the term "encapsulation" refers to the practice of bundling data and methods together within a single unit, called an object. 
Encapsulation allows the internal details and implementation of an object to be hidden from the outside world, providing a clear separation between the internal workings and the external interface.

Here are a few key aspects of encapsulation:

Data and Methods: 
Encapsulation combines data (attributes or variables) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data within a single entity. 
The data is often private or protected, meaning it can only be accessed or modified through specific methods provided by the object.

Data Hiding: 
Encapsulation involves hiding the internal state and implementation details of an object from external entities. 
This means that the inner workings of an object are not directly accessible to other parts of the program, and interactions with the object are done through a defined interface.

Information hiding: 
Encapsulation supports the principle of information hiding, which aims to limit the knowledge or understanding required to use an object. 
The internal details and complexity are encapsulated within the object, allowing other parts of the program to interact with the object using a simpler and well-defined interface.

Data Encapsulation: 
Data encapsulation is a specific aspect of encapsulation where data is enclosed within an object, and access to that data is controlled through methods. 
This helps maintain data integrity and allows for validation, modification, and controlled access to the data.

The benefits of encapsulation include improved code organization, modular design, code reusability, and enhanced maintainability. 
Encapsulation also helps to protect data integrity by enforcing controlled access and modification through defined methods.

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is often implemented using classes and objects. 
By encapsulating data and methods within objects, developers can create more robust and understandable software systems.
