In the examples, I define enums for colors, days of the week, and sizes. 
Each enum represents a fixed set of values that can be used in the code. 
You can assign enum values to variables, compare them, and access any additional properties or methods defined within the enum.

Enums provide a convenient and type-safe way to work with a predefined set of constants in Java.
