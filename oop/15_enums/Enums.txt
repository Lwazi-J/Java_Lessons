The following is an example of an enumeration AKA enum for short. 
It looks similar to a normal class but there are some minor differences.

Example:
public enum Day {
	MONDAY,
	TUESDAY,
	WEDNESDAY;
	THURSDAY;
	FRIDAY;
	SATURDAY;
	SUNDAY;
}

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

public enum Day {
	RED,
        YELLOW,
        BLUE,
        GREEN,
        WHITE,
        BLACK;
}
