Here are some Java code examples that demonstrate my understanding in the automatic garbage collection process.

Example 1: Creating and Discarding Objects

Example 2: Object Finalization


Please note that explicitly invoking System.gc() is not required in most scenarios, as the JVM handles garbage collection automatically based on its own memory management algorithms and requirements. 
The call to System.gc() is included in the examples to suggest garbage collection, but its actual effect depends on the JVM implementation and configuration.
