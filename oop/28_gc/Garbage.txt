Here's a high-level overview of how garbage collection works:

Memory Allocation: 
When objects are created in a programming language, memory is allocated to store their data and associated metadata. 
In Java, objects are typically allocated on the heap.

Reachability Analysis: 
The garbage collector periodically scans the heap to determine which objects are still in use or reachable by the program. 
It starts with a set of root objects, such as global variables or objects referenced from the stack, and follows references to other objects to build a graph of reachable objects.

Marking Phase: 
During the reachability analysis, the garbage collector marks the reachable objects by setting a flag or bit in their metadata. 
Objects that are not marked are considered unreachable and eligible for garbage collection.

Garbage Collection: 
Once the marking phase is complete, the garbage collector identifies the unreachable objects and reclaims their memory. 
This process involves releasing the memory occupied by the unreachable objects and making it available for future memory allocations.

Memory Compaction (optional): 
Some garbage collectors perform an additional step called memory compaction. 
It involves moving the live objects closer together in memory to reduce fragmentation and improve memory allocation efficiency.

Finalization (optional): 
Before an object is garbage collected, it may go through a finalization process where the object's finalize() method (if defined) is invoked. 
This allows the object to perform any necessary cleanup actions before being reclaimed. 
However, the usage of finalize() is discouraged in modern Java programming, and other mechanisms like try-with-resources 
or the AutoCloseable interface are preferred for resource cleanup.
