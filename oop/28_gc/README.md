OOP 19 Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process used in programming languages, such as Java, 
to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed or reachable by the program. 
It is a mechanism provided by the runtime environment to manage memory dynamically, freeing developers from explicitly allocating and deallocating memory.

The purpose of garbage collection is to automate memory management and relieve developers from manual memory allocation and deallocation. 
By automatically reclaiming memory occupied by unreachable objects, garbage collection helps prevent issues such as memory leaks, 
dangling references, and excessive memory consumption. 
It allows developers to focus on writing code without the burden of explicit memory management, 
improving productivity and reducing the risk of memory-related bugs.
