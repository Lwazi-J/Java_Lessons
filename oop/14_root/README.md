In Java, the root of all objects is the java.lang.Object class. 
It is the topmost class in the class hierarchy and serves as the base class for all other classes in Java.

The java.lang.Object class defines several fundamental methods that are inherited by all other classes. 
These methods include equals(), hashCode(), toString(), getClass(), notify(), notifyAll(), and wait(), among others.

By default, every class in Java implicitly extends the java.lang.Object class, either directly or indirectly through inheritance. 
This means that all objects in Java, regardless of their type, ultimately derive from java.lang.Object and inherit its methods.

For example, consider the following class definition:

public class MyClass {
    // class implementation
}

Even though MyClass does not explicitly extend any other class, it still inherits from java.lang.Object because it is the implicit superclass.

Having java.lang.Object as the root of all objects allows for a unified approach to object-oriented programming in Java, enabling common functionality and behavior to be shared across different types of objects.
