In Java, initializers are code blocks that are used to initialize the state of an instance or a class. They are executed automatically during object creation or class loading, depending on the type of initializer.

They are executed when an instance of the class is created, before the constructor.
Instance initializers are useful when you have complex initialization logic that needs to be executed for every instance of a class.
