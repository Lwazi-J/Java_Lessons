In this example, Javadoc comments are added to the class and its methods.
The comments start with /** and end with */. Within the comments, special tags like @param, @return, and @see are used to provide additional information.

To generate the Javadoc documentation for this class, you would run the Javadoc tool provided by the JDK against the source file:

javadoc Person.java
This would generate HTML documentation files, including an index.html file, which can be viewed in a web browser to browse and navigate the generated documentation.

Note that the example above is a basic demonstration, and in real-world scenarios, you would typically provide more detailed and comprehensive documentation, including information about the class's purpose, behavior, and usage guidelines.
