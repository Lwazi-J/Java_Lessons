What is a Javadoc

Javadoc is a documentation generator tool used for generating API documentation in HTML format from Java source code. 
It was created by Oracle and is included in the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
The purpose of Javadoc is to provide a standardized and easily accessible way to document Java code, making it easier for developers to understand and use Java libraries and APIs.

With Javadoc, developers can write special comments in their Java code that describe the purpose, functionality, parameters, return values, and exceptions of classes, interfaces, methods, and fields. 
These comments are written using a specific syntax and conventions, and they are denoted by special Javadoc tags such as `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, and `@see`.

Once the Javadoc comments are added to the code, the Javadoc tool can be run to process the source files and generate HTML documentation. 
The generated documentation includes the API's class and interface hierarchy, detailed descriptions of classes, methods, and fields, and cross-references to related classes and members. 
It also includes the source code itself, if desired.

The resulting Javadoc HTML documentation can be distributed along with the Java code, providing a reference for other developers to understand how to use the code and its various components. 
It is a widely used practice in Java development to include Javadoc comments in code to ensure that the generated documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.
