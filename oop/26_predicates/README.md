Java Predicate

In Java, a Predicate is a functional interface introduced in the Java 8 release as part of the Java.util.function package. 
It represents a boolean-valued function that takes an input and returns a boolean result. 
Predicates are commonly used for filtering or testing elements in collections or arrays.

The Predicate interface defines a single method called test(), which accepts an input of a specified type and returns a boolean value. 
The method signature is as follows:

boolean test(T t);

Here, T represents the type of the input parameter. The test() method is implemented to define the condition or criteria to be evaluated against the input parameter.

Predicates can be used in various scenarios, such as filtering a collection based on a specific condition, checking if an element satisfies a particular requirement, or implementing complex logical conditions
