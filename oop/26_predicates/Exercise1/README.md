Use a predicate to filter for all people over 50. Make sure that you have at least one over 50


In this updated example, we introduce a Predicate called over50Predicate, which checks if a person's age is greater than 50. 
We then apply this predicate to filter the collection of persons using the filterPersons() method.

The filtered persons, who are over 50, are stored in the filteredPersons list, and we iterate over this list to print the information of each person.

Note that in this example, we ensure that there is at least one person over 50 by adding an Emily Davis object with an age of 60 to the collection of persons.
