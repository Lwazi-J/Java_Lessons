An anonymous class must be assigned on the same line that they are instantiated before they can be used. 
It cannot be instantiated again. Once only and that's it.

Rules for anonymous classes.

An anonymous class always has a super-class or interface which is usually not Object.
An anonymous class always overrides a method from the super-class.
Anonymous classes are only ever create once.
Anonymous classes cannot have a constructor.
anonymous classes cannot have a name or be referenced by a name somehow.
