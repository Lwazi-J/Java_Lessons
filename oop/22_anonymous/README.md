OOP 16.3 Anonymous Classes


Java anonymous classes are a special type of local class that do not have a named identifier. 
They are defined and instantiated at the same time, typically used for implementing interfaces or extending classes in a concise manner.

Anonymous classes allow you to define and create a class in a single expression without explicitly declaring a separate class with a name. 
Instead, you directly define the class and its implementation inline where it is needed.


Key characteristics of anonymous classes:

No explicit class declaration: 
Anonymous classes do not have a defined class name. 
They are defined inline at the point of use.

Instantiation during definition: 
Anonymous classes are instantiated at the same point where they are defined.

Can implement interfaces or extend classes:
Anonymous classes are often used for implementing interfaces or extending classes, providing the implementation directly inline.
