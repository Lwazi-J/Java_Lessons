In this example, the Person class represents a simple bean with two properties: "name" and "age". It follows the JavaBeans naming convention for the getter and setter methods.

This example demonstrates how the bean's properties can be accessed and modified using the getter and setter methods.

Please note that while this example showcases the basic principles of the JavaBeans standard, in practice, modern Java frameworks often rely on annotations and additional conventions for configuration and dependency injection. However, the core concept of encapsulating state and behavior within a class and following a naming convention for properties and methods remains relevant.
